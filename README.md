<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Program

This program instantiates a server at a user defined IP address and user-defined, or default, port number that gives the client access to the page "index.html", or other hosted documents by interpreting the client issued GET request from the terminal or FireFox Browser. The client can perform the GET request using a telnet connection or browser.

The server connects to multiple client sessions using threading.

When a user sends a properly formatted request, the server returns the requested data if the data exists and also displays information about the received request. If the user supplies an invalid request in terminal, the server responds with the error and expected input. In both the terminal and browser if the user inputs an invalid file name or bad permissions file, but properly formatted request, the type of error is parsed and displayed by the server terminal and the client is sent a 404 not found splash page or 403 or to a 403 FORBIDDEN ACCESS page. The type of error can be viewed in the server terminal window. The connection is closed upon both a successful or unsuccessful GET request.

The server is equipped to send html and txt, i.e. "plain text" data.

Supported requests are:  
1. "GET / HTTP/1.1"
2. "GET /filename HTTP/1.1"
3. "GET / HTTP/1.0"
4. "GET /filename HTTP/1.0"

Supported file extension types are:
1. .html
2. .txt


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

* Interfacing with the server
```sh
GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)
```
```sh
telnet or an internet browser -- currently tested and functional in FireFox
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/donnerhanson/Simple-Server-In-C.git
```
2. Ensure that index.html, 404.html, and server.c exist within the same directory on your machine
3. Compile the program
```sh
LINUX:
gcc server.c -o server -lpthread -lrt
MacOS:
gcc server.c -o server -lpthread
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

1. Start the server using terminal -- recommended to test on your local ip address and using a port number greater than 1024 and less than 65536. If no port number is specified port 6789 is chosen by the program.
```sh
./server [IP ADDRESS] [PORT NUMBER]
```
2. Sending the Get Command Using a Browser
* Open the internet browser and in the address bar type and enter
```sh
http://[IP ADDRESS]:[PORT NUMBER]/
```
3. Sending the Get Command Using a *nix Terminal
* Open a separate Terminal window, type and enter
```sh
telnet [IP ADDRESS] [PORT NUMBER]
```
Then type
```sh
GET / HTTP/1.0
```
followed by enter.

Incorrect input will receive an error message with the expected user input.

4. Shutting Down the Server  

Because the server is meant to exist in a "forever loop" the server process must be shut down with an interrupt signal. In the server terminal window press the keys <Ctrl> and <C> simultaneously to end the server process.

## Example

1. Example 1:  Basic Retrieval no file specified

```
Donner$ telnet 127.0.0.1 5001
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
GET / HTTP/1.1
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

The goal of this assignment is to build a functional HTTP server. This assignment will teach you the basics At a high level, a web server listens for connections on a socket (bound to a specific port on a host machine). Clients connect to this socket and use a simple text-based protocol to retrieve files from the server. FOne of the key things to keep in mind in building your web server is that the server is translating relative filenames (such as index.html) to absolute filenames in a local file system. For example, you may decide to keep all the files for your server in cstudent/server/files/, which we call the root. When your server gets a request for /index.html, it will pre-pend the root to the specified file and determine if the file exists, and if the proper permissions are set on the file (typically the file has to be world readable). If the file does not exist, a file not found error is returned. If a file is present but the proper permissions are not set, a permission denied error is returned. Otherwise, an HTTP OK message is returned along with the contYou should also note that web servers typically translate "GET /" to "GET /index.html". That is, index.html is assumed to be the filename if no explicit filename is present. The default filename can also be overriddeFor this assignment, you will need to support enough of the HTTP protocol to allow an existing web browser (Firefox, Safari or Internet Explorer) to connect to your web server and retrieve the contents of a sample page from your server.

You will want to become familiar with the interactions of the following system calls to build your system: socket(), select(), listen(), accept(), connect(). We outline a number of resources below with additional information on these system calls. Several books are also availabIf <port> is not passed, you will choose your own default port number.
